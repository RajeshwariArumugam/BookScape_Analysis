BookSpace Explorer
The BookScape Explorer project aims to facilitate users in discovering and analyzing book data through a web application. The application will extract data from online book APIs, store this information in a SQL database, and enable data analysis using SQL queries. The project will provide insights into book trends, user preferences, and reviews, helping users make informed reading choices while also offering a platform for community engagement. This initiative targets avid readers, researchers, and book enthusiasts.
